K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm in Python and Scikit-Learn

Theory
The intuition behind the KNN algorithm is one of the simplest of all the supervised machine learning algorithms. It simply calculates the distance of a new data point to all other training data points. 
The distance can be of any type e.g Euclidean or Manhattan etc. It then selects the K-nearest data points, where K can be any integer. 
Finally it assigns the data point to the class to which the majority of the K data points belong.
